 * 
 * Problem: 
 * 
 * New stickers have arrived at inzva Sanctuary. But not enough stickers for every participant. 
 * So, Havva decides to ask a question to participants and give a sticker for the right answer. 
 * Havva gives the number N to participants and asks them to multiply all the digits except zeros. 
 * Then asks them to apply the same operation to the result, until only one digit left. The right
 * answer is just that number. Yasin really wants those stickers, can you help Yasin to get a sticker?
 * (if you didn't understand the problem you can check out the website)
 * 
 * It is always best practice to add comments on your code. Try to write as neatly as possible.
