 * Problem: 
 * 
 * Arda has got in his house N number of candies for the M number of children visiting his house on Halloween. 
 * The children hang around as a group. It means whenever Arda's bell rings, M number of children appears in 
 * front of his door. Arda himself doesn't like candies. So he wants to give all candies in his house to the children. 
 * Arda, who wants every child who comes to visit him to have an equal number of candies, will not give candy to any 
 * child if it is not possible to distribute the candies fairly.
 * 
 * It is always best practice to add comments on your code. Try to write as neatly as possible.
