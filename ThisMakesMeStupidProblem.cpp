 * Problem: 
 * 
 * You are given a number X, you are expected to calculate the sum of the numbers which are lower than 
 * or equal to X, whose hundreds digit equals to 3.
 * 
 * It is always best practice to add comments on your code. Try to write as neatly as possible.

        Obviously you can simply choose to use a for loop for each number, something like this:

        for(int number : entries)
        {
            int sum = 0;

            for(int i = 0; i <= number; i++)

                }
            }

            cout << sum << endl;
        }

        This method is safe to choose, however calculations are much simpler with the first method.

    I should also note that this solution did not pass testcase 3 and 6. I could not figure it out
